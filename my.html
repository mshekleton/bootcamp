<h1>Making Embedded Near-Field Communication (NFC) Work for Your Brand</h1>

<h2>What is NFC and how does it work</h2>
<p>
    Near-Field Communication (NFC) is a method for communicating over a short distance, typically less than an inch,
    between two objects. One of the most familiar examples of this is touchless payment like Android or Apple Pay. In
    this
    article, we will be discussing communication between a smartphone or a programmer and a an NFC "tag". An NFC tag is
    a passive
    RF circuit that is powered by a phone's radio emissions. This means that passive tags do not contain an batteries,
    which means their lifespan is essentially indefinite and they take of very little space. Most modern smartphones are
    NFC
    enabled, and don't require any third party applications needed to read the tag. Tags can hold records that prompt
    the phone to take actions like adding a contact, connecting to a WiFi network, or launching a website in the
    browser.

<h2>What are the benefits of NFC?</h2>
NFC tags fill in the gaps where

<h3>Ease of use</h3>

<h3>Authentication</h3>

<h3>Serialization</h3>

<h3>Encryption</h3>

<h3>Location and Data</h3>

<h3>Dynamic linking</h3>

<h3>Brand interaction/loyalty</h3>

<h3>Post-sale Data collection and analytics</h3>

<h2>Difficulties of implementation</h2>
Programming tags:
Insertion into manufacturing chain
Security of programmers
Authentication authority
Cost of Implementation/integration with existing websites

<h2>Getting consumers to interact (offer value)</h2>

<h2>Solutions</h2>


<h2>SmartSeal handles all these issues so you don’t have to.</h2>
